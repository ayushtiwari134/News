This is yet another super basic ReactJS news web application which uses 'NewsAPI' to fetch the latest news information which is displayed on the screen in the form of cards. This uses the {useState} and the {useEffect} hooks of React as well, along with small amounts of both Bootstrap5 and TailwindCSS.


{Cannot deploy the application because the API that i am using is a free version and it does not allow to fetch requests in production or deployed builds.}
