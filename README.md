This is yet another super basic ReactJS news web application which uses 'NewsAPI' to fetch the latest news information which is displayed on the screen in the form of cards. This uses the {useState} and the {useEffect} hooks of React as well, along with small amounts of both Bootstrap5 and TailwindCSS.


{Cannot deploy the application because I am using the free version of the API which does not allow to fetch requests in production or deployed builds.}
